Environment impact could be reduced if we can locate and forecast the diffusion area of oil slick in real-time for quick accident rescue measurement. We have designed an oil spill tracking buoy (OSTB), which could track oil slick and transfer its latitude and longitude location periodically by Beidou satellite communication system to monitor terminal. Oil slick tracking ability relies on wind/water sail design which based on hydrodynamic equilibrium model and ocean dynamic analysis. Machinery structure is designed for both air deployment and ship deployment. Laboratory test and field experiment in Jiaozhou Bay, Qingdao, China, have proved the spilled oil tracking ability and easy-deployment of the buoy. With novel construction and a total materials cost of about {\$}140USD, this buoy could monitor offshore area oil spill accidents continuously and provide a potential monitor solution for marine activities.",

abstract="Location-based games seek to move computer gaming out from behind the PC and into the ``real world'' of cities, streets, parks, and other locations. This real-world physicality makes the experience fun for game players, yet it brings the unique challenge of creating and orchestrating such a game. That is, location-based games are often difficult to create, grow, and maintain over long periods of time. Our research investigates how location-based games can be designed to overcome this challenge of scalability. We studied the well-established location-based game of Geocaching through active participation and an online survey to better understand how it has succeeded in maintaining user involvement and growth over the last decade. Findings show that Geocaching benefits by having players directly create game content, including both lightweight and elaborate creations. Geocaching has also made it simple for players to perform game orchestration by monitoring game content, other players, and even non-players. We then characterize location-based games according to various attributes and suggest how the lessons learned from Geocaching could be applied more generally to the design of other location-based games and in which cases they should not be applied.",

  abstract = {The second of three books published by the Center for Environmental Structure to provide a "working alternative to our present ideas about architecture, building, and planning," <I>A Pattern Language</I> offers a practical language for building and planning based on natural considerations. The reader is given an overview of some 250 patterns that are the units of this language, each consisting of a design problem, discussion, illustration, and solution. By understanding recurrent design problems in our environment, readers can identify extant patterns in their own design projects and use these patterns to create a language of their own. Extraordinarily thorough, coherent, and accessible, this book has become a bible for homebuilders, contractors, and developers who care about creating healthy, high-level design. "Brilliant....Here's how to design or redesign any space you're living or working in--from metropolis to room. Consider what you want to happen in the space, and then page through this book. Its radically conservative observations will spark, enhance, organize your best ideas, and a wondrous home, workplace, town will result"--San Francisco Chronicle. A handbook designed for the layman which aims to present a language which people can use to express themselves in their own communities or homes, and to better communicate with each other.},

  comment = {Alexander himself, in his seminal book (Alexander et al, 1978), describes a pattern called “Network of Learning”. The premise of this pattern is that in a society which emphasises teaching, learners become passive and unable to think or act for themselves. He argues that creative, active individuals can only grow up in a society which emphasises learning instead of teaching. The solution he proposes is to replace the structures of compulsory schooling in a fixed place, with decentralised processed of learning which engage learners through contact with many places and people all over the city: workshops, teachers at home, professionals will to take on the young as helpers, older children, museums, youth groups, scholarly seminars, industrial workshops, old people, and so on. This argument resonates with Ilich's call for “deschooling society” (1971) and conviviality (1973).

in Syverson, 98



http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~syverson/papers/vwsim98.html



"Every creative act relies on language. It is not only those creative acts which are part of a traditional society which rely on language: all creative acts rely on pattern languages: the fumbling inexperienced constructions of a novice are made within the language which he has. The works of idiosyncratic genius are also created within some part of language too. And the most ordinary roads and bridges are all built within a language too....



In order to make patterns explicit, so that they can be shared in this new way, we must first of all review the very complex structure of a pattern....



As an element in the world, each pattern is a relationship between a certain context, a certain system of forces which occurs repeatedly in that context, and a certain spatial configuration which allows these forces to resolve themselves. ...



As an element of language, a pattern is an instruction, which shows how this spatial configuration can be used, over and over again, to resolve the given system of forces, wherever the context makes it relevant." (Alexander et al. 1977)

"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."},

@book{Martin17,
  abstract = {By applying universal rules of software architecture, you can dramatically improve developer productivity throughout the life of any software system. Now, building upon the success of his best-selling books Clean Code and The Clean Coder, legendary software craftsman Robert C. Martin ('Uncle Bob') reveals those rules and helps you apply them. Martin's Clean Architecture doesn't merely present options. Drawing on over a half-century of experience in software environments of every imaginable type, Martin tells you what choices to make and why they are critical to your success. As you've come to expect from Uncle Bob, this book is packed with direct, no-nonsense solutions for the real challenges you'll face---the ones that will make or break your projects.},
